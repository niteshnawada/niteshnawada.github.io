## General Software Engineering Questions

### 1. Object-Oriented Programming
**Q: Explain the principles of OOP (encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction).**

**A:** 
- **Encapsulation**: Bundling data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit or class, restricting direct access to some components.
- **Inheritance**: Mechanism where one class acquires the properties (fields) and behaviors (methods) of another.
- **Polymorphism**: Ability to process objects differently based on their data type or class.
- **Abstraction**: Hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features.

**References:**
- [OOP Principles](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/object-oriented-programming-oops-concept-in-java/)

### 2. Data Structures and Algorithms
**Q: Describe how a hash map works.**

**A:** A hash map stores key-value pairs. It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found.

**Q: Explain the differences between a stack and a queue.**

**A:** 
- **Stack**: Last In First Out (LIFO) data structure.
- **Queue**: First In First Out (FIFO) data structure.

**Q: How would you find the shortest path in a graph?**

**A:** Use algorithms like Dijkstra's or Bellman-Ford for weighted graphs, and BFS for unweighted graphs.

**Q: What sorting algorithms are you familiar with, and how do they compare in terms of time complexity?**

**A:** Common sorting algorithms:
- **Quick Sort**: Average O(n log n), Worst O(n^2)
- **Merge Sort**: O(n log n)
- **Bubble Sort**: O(n^2)

### 3. Design Patterns
**Q: What design patterns have you used, and in what scenarios?**

**A:** Common patterns:
- **Singleton**: Used in logging, configuration settings.
- **Observer**: Used in event handling systems.

**Q: Can you explain the Singleton pattern and when you would use it?**

**A:** Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access. Used for logging, configuration, etc.

**Q: Describe the Observer pattern and provide an example of its use.**

**A:** Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified. Used in event handling systems.

## Java and Spring Boot

### 4. Java Basics and Advanced Concepts
**Q: Explain the differences between an abstract class and an interface.**

**A:** 
- **Abstract Class**: Can have instance methods that implement a default behavior. Can have constructors.
- **Interface**: Cannot have instance methods with default behavior (before Java 8), all methods are abstract by default.

**Q: What are the new features introduced in the latest version of Java?**

**A:** Features vary with versions; Java 17 includes pattern matching for switch, sealed classes, and improved Java Flight Recorder.

**Q: How does Java handle memory management and garbage collection?**

**A:** Java uses an automatic garbage collection process that reclaims memory used by objects no longer in use. Different collectors like G1, Serial, and Parallel are used based on performance needs.

**A:** Use `application.properties` or `application.yml` files to define configuration settings. Spring Boot can also use environment variables and command-line arguments.

**Q: Explain the concept of dependency injection and how it is implemented in Spring.**

**A:** Dependency injection is a design pattern that allows a class to have its dependencies provided rather than creating them itself. In Spring, it's implemented using `@Autowired` annotation and configuration classes.
